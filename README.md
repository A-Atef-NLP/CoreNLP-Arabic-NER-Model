# CoreNLP-Arabic-NER-Model
Arabic NER Model for Stanford CoreNLP

I used 200 manuale labled documents with arround 100,000 word.
Documents are from news and Wikipedia.

# Note
Till now it is a start kit. don't expect a very accurate results.
I need to add more data.
Arabic is very complex language so i need to add more feature.
CoreNLP Stemer and POS some times divide the name.
